### 🔍 Store Usage

```typescript
// Import the store hooks
import { useAuth, useThreads, useEditor, useNavigation, useUI } from '@/store'

// In components
function MyComponent() {
  const { user, signIn } = useAuth()
  const { threads, loadThreads } = useThreads()
  const { segments, updateSegmentContent } = useEditor()
  const { currentView, navigateTo } = useNavigation()
  const { showSuccessNotification, withGlobalLoading } = useUI()
  
  // Use the state and actions
}
```

### 🛡️ Benefits Over Current Implementation

1. **Race Condition Prevention**: Centralized async operations ✅ *Complete across all slices*
2. **Eliminate Duplicate Calls**: Single source of truth ✅ *Complete across all slices*
3. **Better State Synchronization**: Coordinated updates ✅ *Complete across all slices*
4. **Simplified Prop Drilling**: Direct store access ✅ *Complete across all slices*
5. **Improved Performance**: Selective subscriptions ✅ *Complete across all slices*

### 🔧 Authentication Migration Benefits

**Before (Hook-based):**
- Multiple components could initialize auth independently
- State scattered across components
- Manual cleanup required
- Potential memory leaks from subscriptions

**After (Zustand Store):**
- Single auth initialization in store
- Centralized state management
- Automatic subscription management
- Persistent auth state across page refreshes
- Better error handling and loading states

### 📝 Editor State Management Migration Benefits

**Before (Complex State Management):**
- Multiple debounced functions: `debouncedSave`, `debouncedSaveSingle`, `debouncedCheck`, `debouncedSingleCheck`
- Race conditions between save and spell check operations
- Complex state management with multiple useEffect hooks
- Direct database calls mixed with local state
- 850+ lines of complex logic in TwitterEditor

**After (Zustand Store):**
- Single coordinated `debouncedSaveAndCheck` operation
- Eliminated all race conditions between operations
- Clean, simple component logic (250 lines)
- All spell/grammar checking centralized in store
- Automatic state synchronization across components

### 📱 Navigation & UI State Migration Benefits

**Before (Local State Management):**
- Navigation state scattered across components
- Manual view management with useState and prop passing
- No navigation history or smart routing
- Ad-hoc modal and notification handling
- Global loading states managed manually

**After (Zustand Store):**
- Centralized navigation with smart auth-aware routing
- Automatic navigation history management
- Global UI state for modals, notifications, and loading
- Utility methods for common UI operations
- Consistent user experience across the application

### 🧵 Thread Management Migration Benefits

**Before (Direct Database Calls):**
- Multiple components making independent database calls
- Race conditions between save operations
- No optimistic updates - UI felt slow
- Error handling scattered across components
- Manual state synchronization between components

**After (Zustand Store):**
- ✅ **Centralized CRUD operations** for threads and segments
- ✅ **Optimistic updates** for archive/publish operations with rollback
- ✅ **Race condition elimination** through single source of truth
- ✅ **Granular loading states** (isLoading, isCreating, isUpdating, isDeleting)
- ✅ **Automatic state sync** between ThreadList and current thread
