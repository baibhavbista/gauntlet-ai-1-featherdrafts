# AI Thread Splitting Feature

## Overview

The AI Thread Splitting feature allows users to paste long-form content and automatically convert it into tweet-sized segments using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. This feature intelligently preserves context, maintains narrative flow, and creates engaging thread segments.

## Implementation Details

### Components Updated
- **thread-list.tsx**: Added toggle UI for AI splitting mode with real-time character counting and tweet estimation
- **threadsSlice.ts**: Extended createThread function to handle AI processing and bulk segment creation
- **database.ts**: Added bulk segment creation functionality
- **thread-detail.tsx**: Enhanced with AI success banner, re-split functionality, and AI indicators
- **app/thread/[threadId]/page.tsx**: Added URL parameter handling for AI success state

### New Files
- **app/api/ai/split-to-threads/route.ts**: OpenAI API integration endpoint
- **lib/ai.ts**: Client-side utility functions for AI operations
- **docs/ai-thread-splitting.md**: Complete feature documentation

## Setup Requirements

### Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Features Included
1. **Smart Toggle**: Easy ON/OFF toggle for AI splitting mode
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Character count and tweet estimation as users type
3. **Intelligent Splitting**: AI preserves context, hashtags, and mentions
4. **Thread Numbering**: Automatic 1/n, 2/n numbering format
5. **Tone Support**: Configurable tone (professional, casual, witty, etc.)
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if AI processing fails
7. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during AI processing

## User Experience Flow

### Thread Creation Flow
1. User clicks "New Thread" 
2. Toggles "AI Thread Splitting" to ON
3. Pastes long-form content into the large textarea
4. Sees real-time character count and estimated tweet count
5. Clicks "Create with AI" button (with spinning sparkle icon)
6. AI processes the content (shows "AI Processing..." indicator)
7. Thread is created with pre-populated tweet segments
8. User is navigated to thread detail view with ?ai=success parameter

### Thread Detail Enhancement Flow
1. **AI Success Banner**: Prominent banner shows "✨ AI Generated Thread" with segment count
2. **AI Indicators**: "AI Enhanced" badge appears in thread statistics
3. **Re-split Option**: "Re-split with AI" button allows users to regenerate segments
4. **Auto-hide**: Success banner automatically disappears after 10 seconds
5. **Manual Dismiss**: Users can manually close the banner with X button
6. **Seamless Editing**: All segments are fully editable like regular threads

## Technical Architecture

### API Prompt Engineering
The OpenAI prompt is carefully designed to:
- Maintain narrative flow between tweets
- Keep each tweet under 280 characters
- Preserve important hashtags and mentions
- Create engaging hooks and conclusions
- Number tweets properly (1/n format)
- Return structured JSON for easy parsing

### Error Handling
- Network errors: Graceful fallback with user-friendly messages
- API quota limits: Clear messaging about service availability
- Invalid responses: JSON parsing error handling
- Rate limiting: Built-in retry logic and user feedback

### Database Integration
- Bulk segment creation for performance
- Automatic thread statistics updates (character count, tweet count)
- Transaction-like behavior (thread created even if AI fails)

## Usage Statistics Tracking
Consider adding analytics to track:
- AI splitting usage rates
- Success/failure rates
- Average processing times
- User satisfaction with AI-generated threads
